#Claim US Tax Treaty Benefits for Royalties

###Use Case:

This is specifically for answering the W-8BEN Form (Filling US Tax Form) regarding ROYALTIES for our accounts on 

1. Apple Developer 
2. Amazon Kindle 
3. and so on... (Please add relevant companies, just do a pull request to add more...)

###NOTE:

Not all countries are included in this treaty. Please see below if your country is included:

[//]: # (//Enumerate countries here)


For people who doesn't reside in the US, you don't need an EIN, SSN, or ITIN. Now, you can use your own country's tax ID number.

[//]: # (Provide instructions on how to get one if they want too.)

###DISCLAIMER:

This is not the official way of answering the "Claim US Tax Treaty Benefit" section in the form. This was made to simplify answering that section based on my knowledge and experience. You should still read the agreement between your country and USA. If you are still unsure on how to answer it, ask help from a Tax Accountant. No one will be liable for any issue that arises from using this work (write up, app, etc). Use this at your own risk.
