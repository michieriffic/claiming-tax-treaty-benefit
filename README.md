#Claim US Tax Treaty Benefits for Royalties for Foreigners or Non-US residents

*Updated as of OCTOBER 12, 2016*

If a tax treaty between the United States and your country provides an exemption from, or a reduced rate of, withholding for certain items of income, you should notify the payor of the income (the withholding agent) of your foreign status to claim the benefits of the treaty. **Generally, you do this by filing Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding with the withholding agent.**

A reduced rate of withholding applies to a foreign person that provides a Form W-8BEN claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty only if the foreign person provides a U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (except for certain marketable securities) and certifies that:

1. It is a resident of a treaty country;
2. It is the beneficial owner of the income;
3. If it is an entity, it derives the income within the meaning of Section 894 of the Internal Revenue Code (it is not fiscally transparent); and
4. It meets any limitation on benefits provision contained in the treaty, if applicable.

This is not the official way of answering the "Claim US Tax Treaty Benefit" section in the form. This was made to simplify answering that section based on my knowledge and experience. You should still read the agreement between your country and USA. If you are still unsure on how to answer it, ask help from a Tax Accountant.
